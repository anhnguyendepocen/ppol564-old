# PPOL564 | Lab 1

## Aim

The follow outlines some of the key points to hit on in the lab. 

1. **Getting up and running**: the primary aim of the lab is to make sure all students are up and running with the necessary software.
	- Have a working python distribution working on their computer.
	- Can open a Jupyter notebook up using the Anaconda Icon and the terminal. 
		* Show how to open up a Jupyter notebook using the terminal. 
			+ If dealing with Windows users, make two suggestions:
				+ Download Git
				+ Ubuntu (linux) is now available on most operative versions of Windows (Windows 10). Have them active this feature. See this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@jthegedus/ubuntu-terminal-on-windows-b8c8558d302c)
	- Have each student open a Jupyter notebook and run a line of code, e.g. `print("Hello World")` or something like that. 
		+ We'll talk about Jupyter Notebook functionality on Wednesday. 
	- All in all, students should have a working terminal and working version of Python3 running on their machines by the end of the lab. This is the most important part of the lab. If some students have their set up figured out already, have those students help those who don't (helping others debug will be a learning experience unto itself).


2. **Walkthrough Git/Github**
	- You show them how to:
		- create a Github repository
		- clone it locally
		- add local changes
		- push those changes locally using: 
			- shell
			- `git` through a Jupyter notebook, using `!`
				+ `!git status`
				+ `!git add .`
				+ `!git commit -m "Some change"`
				+ `!git push`
				+ etc. 
		- Make a change on the remote (i.e. edit the README on Github) and pull that change to the local repository. 
	- Have them practice creating their own repositories and pushing a simple text file (or something along those lines).
