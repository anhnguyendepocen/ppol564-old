    "# Working from the Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line offers an easy way in which to navigate the computer. From it, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- create, move, edit files\n",
    "- install new functionality onto our computer\n",
    "- run scripts in `R` or `python`\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"command line\" line can differ, however, given what machine you're running. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If you're on a **Mac** a unix command line comes installed on your machine. This is your `terminal`, which is an application available on all macs. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If you're on a **Windows** machine, you'll need to activate your Ubuntu terminal by turning on the developer mode on your computer. Instructions on how to do that can be found [**here**](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-bash-shell-command-line-windows-10). (Note that there are also other alternatives, such as [**putty**](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/))\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line offers more control when interacting with your machine. Moreover, we'll need to leverage the command line when using most cloud computing connections. It takes some getting used to, but well worth it once you get the hang of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The point of it** (w/r/t our purposes) is that it'll help us:\n",
    "1. Understand file paths on your computer \n",
    "2. Serves as a common hub from which to work\n",
    "3. Allow for us to generate reproducible coding sequences (via running scripts)\n",
    "4. Streamline work flow\n",
    "    + set projects up\n",
    "    + work between languages\n",
    "    + batch process heavy loads\n",
    "5. Vital when speaking to a computing cluster, working on a virtual machine, or ssh-ing into a local computer "

    "The true power of Git shines as a tool for project collaboration and coordination. Often we want to make local changes to a file and then push those changes to the online remote. In order to push our files to the remote, we'll need to merge our version of the repository with the current state of the repository. If none of the files we changed were changed previously by others, then a merging of files will occur smoothly and automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, sometimes there are **_conflicts_** between branches or remote versions of a repository. Say you changed the some part of a file by deleting a function and a colleague changed the same file by modifying the function. This would be an example of a conflict. Git does not know which version is the correct one, so it will **mark the file as having a conflict** using a special delimiter. \n",

We'll now have both versions of that section of code and will need to manually edit which version we wish to keep (e.g. the upper or bottom part). **The point is that Git is very careful to force you to check when and where discrepancies exist and resolve them yourself.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When updating a local repository, we need to `pull` or `fetch` changes made to the remote. Note that `fetch` will download the available data without merging it into your current workflow, whereas `pull` will download and then integrate the versions. "
