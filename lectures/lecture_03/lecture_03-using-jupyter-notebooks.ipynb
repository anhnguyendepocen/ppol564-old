      "    \"Modular programming refers to the process of breaking a large, unwieldy programming task into separate, smaller, more manageable subtasks or modules. Individual modules can then be cobbled together like building blocks to create a larger application.\\n\",\r\n",
      "    \"\\n\",\r\n",
      "    \"There are several advantages to modularizing code in a large application:\\n\",\r\n",
      "    \"\\n\",\r\n",
      "    \"- **Simplicity**: Rather than focusing on the entire problem at hand, a module typically focuses on one relatively small portion of the problem. If you’re working on a single module, you’ll have a smaller problem domain to wrap your head around. This makes development easier and less error-prone.\\n\",\r\n",
      "    \"\\n\",\r\n",
      "    \"- **Maintainability**: Modules are typically designed so that they enforce logical boundaries between different problem domains. If modules are written in a way that minimizes interdependency, there is decreased likelihood that modifications to a single module will have an impact on other parts of the program. (You may even be able to make changes to a module without having any knowledge of the application outside that module.) This makes it more viable for a team of many programmers to work collaboratively on a large application.\\n\",\r\n",
      "    \"\\n\",\r\n",
      "    \"- **Reusability**: Functionality defined in a single module can be easily reused (through an appropriately defined interface) by other parts of the application. This eliminates the need to recreate duplicate code.\\n\",\r\n",
      "    \"\\n\",\r\n",
      "    \"- **Scoping**: Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps avoid collisions between identifiers in different areas of a program. (One of the tenets in the Zen of Python is Namespaces are one honking great idea—let’s do more of those!)\\n\",\r\n",

    "        - e.g. `cd /Users/me/Desktop/`\n",
    "    - type `jupyter notebook`\n",
    "    - the web application will open up in your default browser. \n",
    "    - from there, click on the notebook and \"spin it up\". The notebook will then be \"running\". \n",
    "    - We can close the notebook by clicking on the `Quit` and `Logout` buttons on the page. \n",
    "        - `Quit` == close the local server (i.e. the web application connection)\n",
    "        - `Logout` == shut down the home page of the web application (but keep the server running)\n",
    "    - We can also close the server connection in the console using the combo of `Control-C` in the console. \n",
    "    - We can also relocate the the server (say if we accidentally close the Notebook) by using the local URL pathway provided when the notebook first activates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Via the Anaconda Navigator** (requires you installing an [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/))\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Click on the Anaconda Icon\n",
    "    - Click \"Launch\" on the jupyter notebook icon.\n",
    "    - The web application will immediately fire up (also yielding a console panel much like what we say via the command line approach). \n",
    "    - One issue is that your working directory (i.e. where the notebook thinks you are on your computer) will be where ever Anaconda is stored (for me, it's at the very top of my file directory). Housing your projects here can be suboptimal for a whole range of reasons, so we'll need to **_change the working directory_** to the actual location that we want. \n",
    "        - One benefit of spinning up a Jupyter notebook via the command line is that your working directory will always be where you initialized the notebook. "

When you are in command mode, you are able to edit the notebook as a whole, but not type into individual cells. Most importantly, in command mode, the keyboard is mapped to a set of shortcuts that let you perform notebook and cell actions efficiently. For example, if you are in command mode and you press c, you will copy the current cell - no modifier is needed. Don't try to type into a cell in command mode. Enter command mode by pressing `Esc` or using the mouse to click outside a cell's editor area.\n",

    "Excerpt from [Real Python post](https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular programming refers to the process of breaking a large, unwieldy programming task into separate, smaller, more manageable subtasks or modules. Individual modules can then be cobbled together like building blocks to create a larger application.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several advantages to modularizing code in a large application:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Rather than focusing on the entire problem at hand, a module typically focuses on one relatively small portion of the problem. If you’re working on a single module, you’ll have a smaller problem domain to wrap your head around. This makes development easier and less error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Modules are typically designed so that they enforce logical boundaries between different problem domains. If modules are written in a way that minimizes interdependency, there is decreased likelihood that modifications to a single module will have an impact on other parts of the program. (You may even be able to make changes to a module without having any knowledge of the application outside that module.) This makes it more viable for a team of many programmers to work collaboratively on a large application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Functionality defined in a single module can be easily reused (through an appropriately defined interface) by other parts of the application. This eliminates the need to recreate duplicate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scoping**: Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps avoid collisions between identifiers in different areas of a program. (One of the tenets in the Zen of Python is Namespaces are one honking great idea—let’s do more of those!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions, modules and packages are all constructs in Python that promote code modularization."
